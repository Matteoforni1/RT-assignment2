This document contains the information required for the second assignment, which include:

- How the code works
- Pseudocode
- How to run the code
- Possible improvements

## How the code works:

The code is divided into four different c++ nodes. These nodes are the following ones:

- The publisher node: this node 
- The subscriber node
- The action client node
- The service node

## Pseudocode:



## How to run the code:



## Possible improvements:
